The logic runs all on the backend (ASP.NET 5.0) and communicate to the frontend via SignalR.

To be able to start the project on your PC, restore the client side library by right-click on the libman.json and choose "Restore Client-Side Libraries". After that you can simply press F5 to run the project.

The project can be hosted easily on any .NET 5 supported platform.

Code, ideas and art are (c) Alain Bertrand. Feel free to re-use the logic and the art as you want as long a credits are given.
